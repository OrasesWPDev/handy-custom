Your goal is to always make sure that the local main branch is updated from github before any work is done.

Do the following: 
1. check to ensure the last PR was merged successfully
2. ensure local is on the main branch
3. ensure main is updated from the repo
4. review and remove any unused branches both locally and on the repo
